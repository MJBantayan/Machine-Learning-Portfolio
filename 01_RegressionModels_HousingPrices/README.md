#**Linear Regression for Housing Prices Prediction**

---

**Objective:**

* Predict housing prices based on variables describing different aspect of the houses.

* Choose the variables with the highest predictive value among the 79 explanatory variables the describe the houses.

* Train and optimize a linear regression model that can predict housing prices with the highest predictive accuracy.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset which was compiled by Dean De Cock. The version used here is downloaded from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) competition page.

[Project Ongoing. Will be updated momentarily...]
